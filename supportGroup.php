This group is for members of the LGBT community who are Cancer survivors, either newly diagnosed, in treatment, posttreatment,
or Long-Term Survivors. We are led by 2 members of the LGBT Community who are also Cancer Survivors.
<br/>
We meet the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of the month from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at The New Mexico Cancer Center (4901
 Lang St NE, ABQ, 87109).
<br/>  
We offer a SAFE and supportive environment where we NEVER judge one another, but rather share our experiences
  to help each other cope with whatever they are going through.
<br/>Each meeting has a general discussion time as well as specific topics which change as soon as we feel it appropriate to
   move on. We also have speakers who make presentations to the group which are related to the topic we are discussing.
   Both the topics and the related speakers are chosen based upon suggestions from the group members.
<br/>For more information, or to join the group, please contact one of our facilitators at (505) 440-0044, or contact Cancer
    Support Now at 505-255-0405 or toll-free 855-955-3500 or email info@cancersupportnow.org
